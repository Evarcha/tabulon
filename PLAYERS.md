# Tabulon Players' Manual

## Overview

Tabulon is an alternative vote counting system for SV quests. It's built to have both a richer syntax for votes and more useful interpretation and analysis of the vote results.

## Making Your Vote

Just post in the thread! The system will read the thread and search for your votes.

## Changing Your Vote

Tabulon will automatically ignore your old votes. If you want to make a change, just make a new post with a new vote in it. However, when you do that, be sure you remake your entire vote - Tabulon won't look at any part of your older votes, even parts you might have wanted to keep.

## Free-Form Votes

Like most quest voting systems, votes in Tabulon are free-form. While a QM may suggest possible voting answers, you don't have to use them. In fact, you can answer however you want! The QM's suggestions are only suggestions. (Unless they say otherwise, in which case listen to them.)

Free-form answers are reported to the QM by the number of people who voted yes and by the number of people who voted no. Explicitly voting no will be treated as a stronger signal of disapproval than not voting on a topic at all.

Acceptable answer formats look like this:

Yes

	[X] Strap yourself to the chair
	[Y] Drink the vial of Beast's Blood

No

	[N] Stick your tongue out at Jack Slash

## Subanswers

Like most quest voting systems, Tabulon allows for answers to be "nested" under other answers. You can provide any text you want as a subanswer; like free-form answers, there aren't any rules about them.

The way you voted on a parent response doesn't affect how you can vote on child responses. For example, if you think something is a bad idea, but you do have an idea on how to make it a little less dangerous, you can vote no on the main idea and yes on your idea to make it safer, like this:

	[N] Show the coin with the Cloudbreak insignia to the man.
 	- [Y] If the man looks alarmed, magically swap it with a penny

You can also have multiple subanswers under one answer, like this:

	[Y] Cuddle with the spider
	 - [Y] Scratch it on the head
	 - [Y] Poke its nose

And have multiple levels of subanswer, like this:

	[Y] Punch Coil
	 - [Y] In the face
	 -- [Y] Try to knock his glasses off

Tabulon will only automatically aggregate answers whose wordings are exactly the same. Try copy-pasting other peoples' answers to make sure the text doesn't have any minor differences that might confuse the system. If you want to do something that's almost like somebody else's answer, but not quite, you might want to just add another level of subanswer beneath it, rather than changing its text.


## Bandwagon Votes

To copy a person's vote in its entirely, vote only

	[X] BeaconHill

or

	[X] @BeaconHill

Don't quote their vote; that won't work.

You can't make changes to a bandwagon vote. If you want to make tweaks or changes, you should copy-paste it and make the changes you want, rather than using a straight bandwagon vote.

Some DMs might want to discourage bandwagon votes. They're not the right choice for every quest.

## Joke Votes

Sometimes, you just want to joke vote. Indicate a joke vote with [Q], [J], or [JK], like

	[Q] Steal Oriko's bukkit
	[J] Switch Madoka's hair ribbon with something hideous and polka-dotted
	[JK] Snuggle with Kyubey

This vote will be ignored by the system. Having a joke vote in your post won't cause it to replace an older vote.
